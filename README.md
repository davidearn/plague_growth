To build the paper, type `make checkpaper`

## Issues

* What do we want to do about probate.rds and willsr? [BMB: what's the question?]
* plotall.R is marked "Deprecated" (in a Makefile) but is in the pipeline [BMB: it's used in the supp]
* We have different file families called plotall and plot_all. What might be better names? [BMB: renamed `plot_all` to `plot_allsources`]
