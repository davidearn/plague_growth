Code to make Earn et al. 2020 plague

Issues
* Warnings in the bbl step
	* Warning--can't use both author and editor fields in Lath85
	* Warning--can't use both volume and number fields in Ligo06
* probate.rds and willsr
* plotall.R is marked "Deprecated" (in a Makefile) but is in the pipeline
* I really don't like that we have plotall and plot_all. What do they do?
* CHAINING! I think texdeps is failing to chain through includes
