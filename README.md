Issues
* Warnings in the bbl step
	* Warning--can't use both author and editor fields in Lath85
	* Warning--can't use both volume and number fields in Ligo06
* What do we want to do about probate.rds and willsr?
* plotall.R is marked "Deprecated" (in a Makefile) but is in the pipeline
* We have different file families called plotall and plot_all. What might be better names?
